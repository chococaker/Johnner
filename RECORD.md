## v. Ambiorix

Current record: `5 1/2 - 0`

**[11/20/2025]**: [Lichess as Firefly008](https://lichess.org/A0q4ntxp) (`1-0`)

 Strong game by Johnner, playing super solidly and spotting a bishop sacrifice. Ambiorix's move generation was broken; promptly debugged post-game.

**[11/21/2025]** [Lichess as Firefly008](https://lichess.org/Gfzn5X8W) (`1-0`)

Johnner strikes in the center again, and Ambiorix's lack of PSTs is its downfall. It blunders and gets crushed due to a devastating rook attack down the center of the board.

**[11/22/2025]** [Lichess as Firefly008](https://lichess.org/ZJOR3KcM) (`1-0`)

Ambiorix still doesn't have PSTs, so it loses more quickly. It gets mated in the middle of the board, swarmed by pieces in a measly 18 moves.

**[11/23/2025]** [Lichess as Firefly008](https://lichess.org/mWzdh2f2) (`1-0`)

Ambiorix needs something to help it make good moves in the opening. Just _something_. It takes a couple more moves, but Ambiorix collapsed under the pressure of an attack after pushing all its pawns.

**[11/28/2025]** [Lichess as Firefly008](https://lichess.org/zJERFUGz) (`1/2-1/2`)

Ambiorix plays horribly and is completely lost, but Johnner blunders a draw due to a bug in the quiesence search. Once that's fixed, Johnner will bounce back stronger than ever.

**[11/29/2025]** [Lichess](https://lichess.org/cUOuvww2) (`1-0`)

Johnner and Ambiorix are finally running on time-controlled UCI, and can play with time controls. They both blunder a couple of times without human intervention (letting the bot run deeper when it wishes to play an inaccurate move), but Johnner ekes out a victory by the end.
